# LAB #6 NOTES

* Lab Files with Starter Code: https://github.com/paulnguyen/cmpe172/tree/main/labs/lab6

In this Lab, you will be exploring Spring REST APIs and porting a Starbucks REST API written in Go to Java Spring.  In addition, you will be deploying your Starbucks API to Google Cloud (GKE).  

Your work should be committed on a regular basis (each day you have a change) to your assigned GitHub Private Repo in the https://github.com/nguyensjsu organization.  Your submission should include all the source code and notes on your work (including required screenshots) in README.md (GitHub Markdown).  

* In the /labs/lab6 folder, include
  * spring-rest
  * spring-starbucks-api
  * insomnia-project.json
  * postman-collection.json
  * images (screenshots)
  * README.md (lab notes)


# Building REST services with Spring

* https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.2.4/api
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas-examples

Follow the Tutorial from Spring Guides at https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/.  As you build the REST API in the example, test the API using CURL as well as with an API Development Tool -- Postman (https://www.postman.com/).  

All work for this Turtorial will be done locally.  There is no requirement for deployment to Google Cloud.

    Project: Gradle Project
    Language: Java Language (JDK 11)
    Spring Boot Version: 2.4.3
    Group: com.example
    Artifact: spring-rest
    Name: spring-rest
    Package Name: come.example.spring-rest
    Packaging: Jar
    Dependencies:
        Spring Web
        Spring Data JPA
        Spring HATEOAS
        H2 Database
 ```

HINTS:

* If you run into any compilation errors, here are the Imports you will need in the Controllers.
* For other classes, not all of the imports below are needed.  Refer to appropriate Java Doc.

Test your REST API using the Postman Collection provided.

# Starbucks End-to-End Example


## Porting the REST API to Spring

Build and Run the provided Starbucks API in Go.  See Demo in class on how to setup, build and run a Go Application.  Then test the Starbucks API, use the provided Insomnia Project.  Note:  Your implementation just needs to be a Level-2 (CRUD) Rest API -- that is, Hypermedia (Level-2 / HATEOAS).

![insomnia-project](images/insomnia-project.png)

The API Specification is as follows.  Port this API into Spring REST and H2 Database JPA and commit your work in a folder named:  spring-starbucks-api.  Test your API using Insomnia or Postman (modify the Insomnia/Postman as needed).

The Starbucks API Specification is as follows:

```
GET 	/ping
		Ping Health Check.

GET 	/cards 
		Get a list of Starbucks Cards (along with balances).

		[
		  {
		    "CardNumber": "498498082",
		    "CardCode": "425",
		    "Balance": 20.00
		  },
		  {
		    "CardNumber": "627131848",
		    "CardCode": "547",
		    "Balance": 20.00
		  }
		]		

POST 	/cards
		Create a new Starbucks Card.

		{
		  "CardNumber": "627131848",
		  "CardCode": "547",
		  "Balance": 20.00
		}

GET 	/cards/{num}
		Get the details of a specific Starbucks Card.

		{
		  "CardNumber": "627131848",
		  "CardCode": "547",
		  "Balance": 20.00
		}		

GET 	/card/{num}/{code}
		Validate Card 

		{
		  "CardNumber": "627131848",
		  "CardCode": "547",
		  "Balance": 20.00
		}	

POST    /order/register/{regid}
        Create a new order. Set order as "active" for register.

	    {
	      "Drink": "Latte",
	      "Milk":  "Whole",
	      "Size":  "Grande"
	    }         

GET     /order/register/{regid}
        Request the current state of the "active" Order.

DELETE  /order/register/{regid}
        Clear the "active" Order.

POST    /order/register/{regid}/pay/{cardnum}
        Process payment for the "active" Order. 

GET     /orders
        Get a list of all active orders (for all registers)

DELETE 	/cards
		Delete all Cards (Use for Unit Testing Teardown)

DELETE 	/orders
		Delete all Orders (Use for Unit Testing Teardown)
```

## Explore the Sample Node.js and Java Mobile App Simulator (Optional)

This section is not required, but is a "preview" to the next Lab (Lab #6).  There are REST Client Sample Apps in starbucks-app and starbucks-nodejs.  Run these Apps against the Starbucks Go API and explore how they work.

In future Labs, you will have to modify these Apps to work with your Spring Starbucks API.


### Example Workflow

1. Starbucks App (Mobile App Simulator)

* Requires Gradle 4.9 and Java JDK 8
* Launch and Login with PIN: 1234 
* See starbuccks-app.xlsx 

![1-starbucks-app](images/1-starbucks-app.png)

2. Placing an Order on the Starbucks Cash Register (Node.js App)

* Note: To run Node.js App, use Node.js version: v8.15.0

![2-starbucks-register-place-order](images/2-starbucks-register-place-order.png)

3. Run Starbucks API (Compile and run in Go)

* Note: To run Go API App, use GO version: 1.11 (code doesn't support modules yet)

* Build and Run API locally (see Makefile Rules)

```
	> go version
	go version go1.11.1 darwin/amd64
	> set GOPATH to working dir
	export GOPATH=$(pwd);export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin;echo $GOPATH
	> go build starbucks
	> ./starbucks
```

* Alternatively, run via Docker Image:  paulnguyen/starbucks-api:v1.0

```
	docker run --name starbucks -p 3000:3000 -td paulnguyen/starbucks-api:v1.0
```

4. Paying on the Starbucks App

![4-starbucks-app-pay](images/4-starbucks-app-pay.png)

5. See Balance on Starbucks Card after Payment

![5-starbucks-app-paid-balance](images/5-starbucks-app-paid-balance.png)

6. Check Starbucks Cash Register for Successful Payment (Node.js App)

![6-starbucks-register-paid-for-order](images/6-starbucks-register-paid-for-order.png)

7. Sample REST API Calls from Insomnia (List Cards)

![7-rest-api-cardsp](images/7-rest-api-cards.png)

8. Sample REST API Calls from Insomnia (List Orders)
